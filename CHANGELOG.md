# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.3] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- Section — variant/layout demo togglers in the docs were targeting the wrong element due to a broken descendant selector; togglers now hit the demo section.

### Changed
- Footer — restructured for DGA compliance. See the [Footer doc page](https://mazin-musleh.github.io/NDS-vanilla/ui-shell/footer.html) for the current markup and class names.
- Section — when `.nds-section-image` precedes `.nds-section-head`, the head now stacks as a column with the image flush below; previously had a margin gap.

### Migrating from v1.0.2

Replace your bundled `nds-main.min.css` and `nds-main.min.js` with the v1.0.3 versions, then re-copy your footer markup from the [Footer doc page](https://mazin-musleh.github.io/NDS-vanilla/ui-shell/footer.html) — the old footer structure is no longer supported.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- Metric — new card+chart composite component for KPI tiles.
- Chart — `spotlight`, `padding`, and `direction` options; x-axis labels auto-rotate and decimate when crowded; line charts get a touch-friendly snap crosshair.
- Fonts — IBM Plex Sans Latin1 faces (Regular / Medium / SemiBold / Bold) ship locally so each weight renders truly instead of being synthesized.
- Icons — `trade-up`, `arrow-up-02`, and `arrow-down-02` selectable on the inline icon set.

### Fixed
- Scroll-more — divider always renders; flex children no longer jitter in width on re-bind.
- Components no longer leak listeners on teardown or after being moved into a portal — chart, dropmenu, tooltip, and mainnav release cleanly.
- Lang-switcher — direction toggle reflects live `dir` / `lang` attribute changes.
- Mainnav — drawer and open dropdowns close when a modal opens; `.nds-fit` dropdowns stay clamped inside the viewport on narrow screens.
- Topbar — no flash of the Saudi flag SVG and digital-stamp tab on load; both stay hidden until the loader reveals them.
- Tables, pagination, and console — icon-only sort buttons expose accessible labels.
- Dark theme — `--text-oncolor-primary` corrected for proper contrast.

### Changed
- Buttons — size math reworked; pixel sizes shift slightly.
- Hero swiper — navigation rebuilt: arrow buttons and pagination now group under `.nds-swiper-navigation` (with arrows nested in `.nds-swiper-buttons`); `.nds-swiper-button-prev` / `.nds-swiper-button-next` classes are gone — see migration.
- Hero — slider preloads only on home pages (was preloading on every page); first hero image and FOUC scripts reorder for faster perceived paint elsewhere.
- `NDS.scrollLock` is now a public helper for components that need to lock body scroll.
- Scrollbars — light and dark themes use a unified scrollbar color.

### Migrating from v1.0.1

**Required step**

Replace your bundled `nds-main.min.css` and `nds-main.min.js` (and the matching `assets/fonts/` IBM Plex Sans files, if you self-host) with the v1.0.2 versions.

**Markup updates required in your pages**

- **Hero swiper navigation** — wrap your existing arrow buttons and pagination in two new containers, and drop the `.nds-swiper-button-prev` / `.nds-swiper-button-next` classes. The arrow `<button>` elements keep the same `nds-btn nds-subtle nds-icon-only nds-oncolor` styling classes plus `nds-prev` / `nds-next`; only the surrounding structure and the redundant `swiper-button-*` classes change.

  **Before (v1.0.1):**
  ```html
  <button class="nds-btn nds-subtle nds-oncolor nds-icon-only nds-prev nds-swiper-button-prev"
          aria-label="Previous slide" hidden></button>
  <button class="nds-btn nds-subtle nds-oncolor nds-icon-only nds-next nds-swiper-button-next"
          aria-label="Next slide" hidden></button>
  <div class="nds-swiper-pagination" hidden></div>
  ```

  **After (v1.0.2):**
  ```html
  <div class="nds-swiper-navigation">
      <div class="nds-swiper-buttons">
          <button class="nds-btn nds-subtle nds-icon-only nds-oncolor nds-prev"
                  aria-label="Previous slide" hidden></button>
          <button class="nds-btn nds-subtle nds-icon-only nds-oncolor nds-next"
                  aria-label="Next slide" hidden></button>
      </div>
      <div class="nds-swiper-pagination" hidden></div>
  </div>
  ```

  The slide structure (`.nds-swiper-wrapper > .nds-swiper-slide`) is unchanged.

**Visual shifts to verify (no markup change needed)**

- **Button pixel sizes** shift slightly with the new size math.
- **Hero slider arrow buttons** sit at a different position after the markup update — the swiper-wide arrow rebuild changed how arrows position relative to the slider edges.
- **Card text alignment** — `.nds-card-text` pins to `flex-start`; cards whose copy was centering by inheritance will now left-align.
- **Inline `<i>` icons** align to `text-bottom` so they sit on the text baseline.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- `--typo-text-2xs-FS` / `--typo-text-2xs-LH` — a new smallest step on the type scale; badges and other tight UI chrome migrate to it.
- Filter — "All" radio is auto-prepended so radio filters can be cleared.
- Link — external-link badge is now skipped on icon-only / image-only anchors.

### Fixed
- Service template — rating dropmenu's label + stars now stack (previously rendered on one line — a layout bug in the rate-this-service prompt).
- Link `:visited` / `:focus` colors apply everywhere. Previously gated to `.nds-content-section` only; footer, alert, breadcrumb, side-nav etc. now color on those states.
- `.nds-oncolor` is honored inside content sections (was silently overridden by the primary fallback).
- `.nds-accordion.nds-card` honors the accordion's gap and full width. Previously the card's `var(--_card-gap)` (3xl) leaked over the accordion's `gap: 0`, and the card's 360px default `max-width` capped the accordion. Now spans full width with no gap between items.
- Forms — Chrome a11y warnings silenced: autocomplete hints and field names added.
- Forms — autofill no longer bleeds through inputs, and the focus ring no longer collides with the autofill state.
- Forms — voice-input button no longer stacks click listeners when re-initialized.
- Components reparented to portals preserve state across the move (impacts modals, dropmenus, tooltips, mainnav).
- Footer — standalone `<hr>` divider is visible on the green variant.
- Services-list — Details button points at `service-template` and the trailing-slash 404 is gone.

### Changed
- Hero slider only preloads on the home layout (was preloading on every page).
- First hero image preloads and FOUC-prevention scripts have been reordered for faster perceived paint.
- Inline `<i>` icons align to `text-bottom` so they sit cleanly on the text baseline.
- Footer copyright is bolder (`font-weight: 600`) and reads on the green background without a custom dim color.
- Footer — "Template developed by..." author credit removed from rendering.

### Migrating from v1.0.0

**Required step**

Replace your bundled `nds-main.min.css` and `nds-main.min.js` with the v1.0.1 versions.

**Markup updates required in your pages:** None.
