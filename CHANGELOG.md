# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- `--typo-text-2xs-FS` / `--typo-text-2xs-LH` — a new smallest step on the type scale; badges and other tight UI chrome migrate to it.
- Filter — "All" radio is auto-prepended so radio filters can be cleared.
- Link — external-link badge is now skipped on icon-only / image-only anchors.

### Fixed
- Service template — rating dropmenu's label + stars now stack (previously rendered on one line — a layout bug in the rate-this-service prompt).
- Link `:visited` / `:focus` colors apply everywhere. Previously gated to `.nds-content-section` only; footer, alert, breadcrumb, side-nav etc. now color on those states.
- `.nds-oncolor` is honored inside content sections (was silently overridden by the primary fallback).
- `.nds-accordion.nds-card` honors the accordion's gap and full width. Previously the card's `var(--_card-gap)` (3xl) leaked over the accordion's `gap: 0`, and the card's 360px default `max-width` capped the accordion. Now spans full width with no gap between items.
- Forms — Chrome a11y warnings silenced: autocomplete hints and field names added.
- Forms — autofill no longer bleeds through inputs, and the focus ring no longer collides with the autofill state.
- Forms — voice-input button no longer stacks click listeners when re-initialized.
- Components reparented to portals preserve state across the move (impacts modals, dropmenus, tooltips, mainnav).
- Footer — standalone `<hr>` divider is visible on the green variant.
- Services-list — Details button points at `service-template` and the trailing-slash 404 is gone.

### Changed
- Hero slider only preloads on the home layout (was preloading on every page).
- First hero image preloads and FOUC-prevention scripts have been reordered for faster perceived paint.
- Inline `<i>` icons align to `text-bottom` so they sit cleanly on the text baseline.
- Footer copyright is bolder (`font-weight: 600`) and reads on the green background without a custom dim color.
- Footer — "Template developed by..." author credit removed from rendering.
